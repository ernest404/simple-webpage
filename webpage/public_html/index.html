    <h2>Biography</h2>
    <p>Hello, I'm Mercyline, and here's a brief biography about me. 
        I was born in Nandi County on the 20th of May, 1997. For my primary education, I attended FR. Kuhn Girls' Primary School - Nandi County. 
        There, I completed my Kenya Certificate of Primary Education (KCPE) in the year 2010, achieving a mean grade of 'B'.
        I then progressed to secondary education at St. Joseph's Girls' High School - Chepterit, where I graduated in 2014 with a mean grade of 'B'. 
        Following this, I pursued higher education at Maseno University, where I earned a Bachelor of Arts in Business Studies with Information Technology in 2019.
        Most recently, in 2022, I completed a Higher Diploma in Business Administration at Kenya Technical Trainers College. Since then, I have been engaged in the teaching profession. 
        I worked at Equip Africa Institute in the Business Department and also collaborated with Go Care Institute, where I remained until the 31st of August.</p>
    <p>My favorite quote is:  </p>
    <blockquote>The magic you are looking for is in the work you are avoiding.</blockquote>
    <p>
        I appreciate this quote because it motivates me to face and address the difficult or less appealing aspects of a situation..
